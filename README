// Your mission, should you choose to accept it,
// is to profit from the win32::Window class I made in order
// to create a command-line program that then launches an instance of a win32::Window
// that remains open until you hit the X in the top right of the window.

// Confirm that the window instance you have created responds to resizing, maximising, etc,
// and that your application ends when the window is closed. 

// You may need to carefully look at the code
// in the header file. You may use any resources you can find online to tackle the mission, like
// MSDN and stack overflow. You will also definitely need to know about classes in c++ in general,
// and how to include the code from the header file in your VS project.

// Level of difficulty: Intermediate. GL OM!
